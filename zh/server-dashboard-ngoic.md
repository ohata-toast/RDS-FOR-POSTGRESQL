## Server Dashboard

You can visualize performance metrics in chart form on the server dashboard. Charts are arranged according to a pre-set layout. Metrics are collected once a minute and kept for up to 1 year. The retention period for each collecting unit is as follows.

| Collecting Unit | Retention Period |
|-----------------|------------------|
| 1 minute           | 1 year         |

## Layout

You can use the layout to indicate the size and location of the chart. When activated, `Basic System Metrics` and `Basic PostgreSQL Metrics ` are provided as default layouts. You cannot change or delete the default layout. Additionally, you cannot add charts, change or delete added charts. To view information in a chart that is not included in the main layout, you can add a chart by creating a new layout.

❶ click **Manage Layout** to display a pop-up window to manage the layout.
❷ You can create a layout by clicking on **+ Create Layout**.
    - Enter a layout name and click **Create** to create a layout.
❸ Click the button to change the layout added.
❹ Click the button to delete the layout added.

### Add Charts to Layout

❶ Select the desired layout.
❷ Click **+ Add Chart** to display a pop-up window where you can add charts.
❸ Select the check box to select multiple metrics to add.
❹ When you click metrics name, the chart appears in the left preview area.
❺ Click **Add** to add all selected charts.

### Change and delete charts in the layout

❶ Click and drag and drop the top area of the chart to move the location.
❷ You can change the size of the chart by dragging and dropping the lower right area of the chart.
❸ Click **x** in the top right corner of the chart to delete the chart from the layout.

## Chart

You can view various performance metrics of DB instance in chart format. Each performance metric consists of different types of charts. In addition to basic system metrics, PostgreSQL provides a variety of performance metrics. Metrics that can be checked by chart are as follows.

## Server Group

Server groups allow you to view performance metrics for multiple DB instances in a single chart. Performance metrics appear in a chart for each DB instance that belongs to a server group. Charts of multiple performance metrics are all changed to individual performance metrics in the server group.

### Create a Server Group

![server-dashboard-group-add](https://static-station.ngoic.com/v1/AUTH_c8bd5293535a46f8bc6705b349f67ea3/cdn/prod_rds_postgres/20240813/server-dashboard-group-add-en.png)

❶ When you click **+ Add Group** a pop-up window appears where you can create a group.
❷ Select DB instance to add to the server group.

### Set a Server Group

DB instances and server groups appear together in the list of servers to the left of the server dashboard.

![server-dashboard-group-manage](https://static-station.ngoic.com/v1/AUTH_c8bd5293535a46f8bc6705b349f67ea3/cdn/prod_rds_postgres/20240611/server-dashboard-group-manage-en.png)

❶ Click **+** or **-** to expand or close the server group.
❷ When you click a DB instance that belongs to a server group, Select Color pop-up appears where you can change the color that appears in the chart.
